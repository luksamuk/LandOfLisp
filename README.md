# Land of Lisp

This is not really a serious repository. This was only created to track my progress while reading the book "Land of Lisp", by Conrad Barski.

Most of this code was derived from the book, with some comments I made as reminders for better knowing the language and etc. I won't be including build instructions nor anything, because there is just no point. To know what I'm talking about on each file, take a look at the book.

It's an excellent book for a lisper, though. You should definitely buy it.
