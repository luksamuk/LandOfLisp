## Introduction

This repository was created to track my progress  while reading and solving the
exercises of the book "Land of Lisp", by Conrad Barski.

Most of this code was derived from the book, with some comments I made as
reminders for better knowing the language and etc. I won't be including build
instructions nor anything, because there is just no point. To know what I'm
talking about on each file, take a look at the book.

One more thing to add is that <strong>I am using SBCL for this book,</strong>
therefore, this may imply that I changed something here and there, since
SBCL doesn't have CLISP's built-in extensions. For things such as streams,
for example, I had to use Quicklisp to aid me.

It's an excellent book for a lisper; you should definitely buy it.
