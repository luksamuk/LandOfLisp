## Introduction

This repository was created to track my progress  while reading and solving the
exercises of the book "Land of Lisp", by Conrad Barski.

Most of this code was derived from the book, with some comments I made as
reminders for better knowing the language and etc. I won't be including build
instructions nor anything, because there is just no point. To know what I'm
talking about on each file, take a look at the book.

It's an excellent book for a lisper; you should definitely buy it.
